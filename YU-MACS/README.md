In the Summer of 2020, I worked on a team of four interns to develop the Machine-automated Academic Communication Service (MACS) for the Yeshiva University Office of Admissions. MACS is a full-stack application to facilitate chat flow between prospective YU students and an intelligent chat-bot, with the option to pass the conversation off to a human agent from the Admissions Office. 

Included in this folder is the handoff documentation for the entire product (MACS Handoff Doc), as well as the Git repos for the chat-bot code (YU-MACS-CHATBOT) and the UI (YU-CHATBOT-UI).
